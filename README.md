# Robot-Arm-Kinematics
Robot arm has three links of length L0, L1, L2 and three joints J0, J1, J2

Forward Kinematics
-
- Find the movement of the end effector and the joint positions as you control the joint angles

Inverse Kinematics
-
- Find the angles of the joints that will result in a desired end effector position
- Implemented inverse kinematics using the jacobian method
